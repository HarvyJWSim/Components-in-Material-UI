# Implementing Google's Material Design in React using "Material-UI"

## What is Google's Material Design & Material-UI?
Google has introduced a unified system called Material Design integrating UI components that apply Material design guidelines, for web application and mobile application. Material-UI is the implementation of Material design components in React, made possible by engineers at Call-Em-All (github link: https://github.com/mui-org/material-ui).

## Rationale of this guide
This guide serves as a sharing in personal experience in making practical and effective use of Google Material/Material-UI components in designing the user interface of application, particularly in web application that will be useful for novice in Goggle Material/Material-UI. 

I personally find the [Material Design Guidelines by Google] (https://material.io/guidelines/) is very comprehensive for beginners in application UI design decisions, particularly on the illustration of "do's and dont's".

To visualise how these components are utilised in application, [Components Documentation by Material-UI] (https://www.material-ui.com/#/components/app-bar) really opens your mind to the possibilites of the components design. 

Due to the variety of components, I find it diffcult to make UI design decisions, particularly which components should be used at which section of the page layout. Thus, I hope this guidelines might help you in the UI design decisions.

## How do I benefit from this guide? 
- Understand the in-depth typical examples of most of the Material components.
- Understand the possbile combinations / interactions between components. (future work) 
- You are highly recommended to read [Material Design Guidelines by Google] (https://material.io/guidelines/) and [Components Documentation by Material-UI] (https://www.material-ui.com/#/components/app-bar) as this guide offers supplementary information about Material-UI components applications. 
- The components are categorised into three classes based on their applications in UI design.
- Some of the basic components are not being discussed (eg: text field, select field) in depth in this guide.
